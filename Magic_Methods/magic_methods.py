'''
create a rectangle class which implements:

an __init__ method which sets the rectangles height and width
a __str__ method which returns a string which is an ascii-art drawing of the rectangle
an __int__ method which returns the rectangle's area

Feel free to play around with implementing any of the other magic methods if you want to
